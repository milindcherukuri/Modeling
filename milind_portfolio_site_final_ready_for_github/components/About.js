      <p>
        I’m Milind, a 6'1\" model with a strong stage presence and a natural comfort in front of the lens.
        With a unique blend of analytical mindset and artistic expression, I bring creativity and confidence
        to every project—whether it’s editorial, commercial, or lifestyle modeling. My background in technology
        and research gives me a sharp eye for detail and aesthetics, which translates seamlessly into visual storytelling.
