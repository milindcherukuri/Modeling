        I’m Milind, a 6'1" model with a strong stage presence and a natural comfort in front of the lens.
        With a unique blend of analytical mindset and artistic expression, I bring creativity and confidence
        to every project—whether it’s editorial, commercial, or lifestyle modeling.
        My background in technology and research gives me a sharp eye for detail and aesthetics,
        which translates seamlessly into visual storytelling.
